# H2E™ — HER2NI Evaluation

**H2E™** is the licensed reference implementation for **HER2NI evaluation**:  
an interaction-level telemetry and analysis suite for detecting drift, instability,
and collapse in multi-turn human–AI and agentic systems.

This repository contains the **commercial evaluator implementation**.
It is distributed privately under license.

---

## What This Is

H2E™ operationalizes the HER2NI research protocol as a **practical evaluation tool**.

It provides:
- interaction-trajectory scoring (not point outputs)
- per-turn coherence metrics (Cₛ, Sₛ, Hₛ)
- time-series analysis Hₛ(t)
- drift, volatility, and collapse detection
- reproducible audit artifacts (JSON / CBOR)

H2E™ is designed for:
- AI safety & evaluation teams
- red-teaming and oversight groups
- agent runtime and platform teams
- applied research organizations
- audit and investigation workflows

---

## What This Is Not

H2E™ is **not**:
- a model training method
- a weight-level alignment technique
- a control or enforcement system
- a truth or correctness oracle
- a diagnostic or clinical tool
- an automatic certification authority

H2E™ produces **descriptive telemetry**.
Interpretation and action remain the responsibility of the user or institution.

## Relationship to HER2NI (Research)

- **HER2NI** is the public, model-agnostic research protocol  
  documenting interaction-level coherence metrics and theory.

- **H2E™** is the **official reference implementation** of that protocol for evaluation use.

Research specifications, papers, and DOIs live at:  
https://her2ni.org

This repository does **not** replace or redefine the public protocol.

---

## Licensing

H2E™ is **licensed software**.

A license grants:
- access to the evaluator package
- reference telemetry schemas
- baseline scoring pipelines
- test vectors (as available)
- integration guidance (tiered)

A license does **not** grant:
- ownership of the HER2NI protocol
- exclusivity over the research designation
- certification or endorsement rights unless explicitly contracted
- any medical or regulatory approval

## Distribution & Access

This repository is intentionally private.

Distribution occurs via:
- direct license agreement
- controlled access for pilots or evaluations
- versioned releases provided to licensees

If you are seeing this repository without context,
please contact the maintainers.
