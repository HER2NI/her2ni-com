# HER₂™ — Forensic Evidence System for Artificial Intelligence (Commercial)

**HER₂™** is a licensed forensic evidence system for artificial intelligence.

It produces **recomputable, non-normative integrity records** of LLM and agent
interaction trajectories for audit, litigation, due diligence, and incident
reconstruction.

This repository serves as the **commercial coordination and access point** for
HER₂™.  
It does **not** contain the full private system source code.

## What This Repository Is

This repository provides:

- a public overview of the HER₂™ system and its scope,
- links to documentation and overview materials,
- licensing and pilot engagement information,
- coordination for institutional access.

It is intended for:

- venture capital and private equity firms,
- banks, fintechs, and insurers,
- audit, compliance, and governance teams,
- litigation support and expert witness firms,
- insurance underwriters and policy labs.

Private system components are provided **only under license**.

## What HER₂™ Is

HER₂™ is an **evidence layer**, not a control system.

At a high level, HER₂™:

- records interaction trajectories as immutable evidence artifacts,
- binds inputs, outputs, evaluator context, and provenance metadata,
- preserves temporal causality (append-only, no overwrite),
- supports independent replay and recomputation,
- produces signed evidence bundles suitable for adversarial review.

HER₂™ operates **without access to model weights or training data** and does not
modify, tune, or suppress model outputs.

---

## What HER₂™ Is Not

HER₂™ is intentionally constrained.

It is **not**:

- a model training or alignment method,
- a compliance certification by default,
- a control or enforcement system,
- a correctness, truth, or ideology evaluator,
- a diagnostic or clinical tool.

HER₂™ produces **evidence artifacts**, not judgments.  
Interpretation and decision-making always remain human- or institution-governed.

## Relationship to HER2NI (Research)

- **HER2NI** is the public, model-agnostic research protocol describing
  interaction-level coherence metrics and theory.
- **HER₂™** is a licensed system built on the HER2NI protocol family,
  extended for forensic integrity recording and evidentiary use.

HER2NI research materials, specifications, and DOIs are available at:  
https://her2ni.ai

This repository does **not** replace or redefine the HER2NI protocol.

---

## HER₂™ Pilot Access

HER₂™ is currently available via **private pilot engagements**.

Pilots are designed to answer one question:

> *Does preserving interaction trajectories as recomputable evidence
> materially improve auditability, risk analysis, or dispute resolution
> in your context?*

For a concise overview of scope and limitations, see:

## Licensing & Access

HER₂™ is **licensed software**.

A license may grant access to:

- private system components,
- evidence schemas and manifests,
- integrity and provenance tooling,
- pilot-scoped evaluation materials,
- integration guidance.

A license does **not** grant:

- ownership of the HER2NI protocol,
- exclusivity over research designations,
- certification or endorsement rights unless explicitly contracted,
- any medical or regulatory approval.
